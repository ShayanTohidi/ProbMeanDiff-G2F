# ProbMeanDiff-G2F

These datasets are constructed based on yearly phenotypic datasets in [G2F] (https://www.genomes2fields.org/resources/). Thus, we end up with a lot of complete datasets with replication.

## Introduction

Selecting the best crop cultivars is one of the main steps in the plant breeding process. Previously, it was common to use the mean yield of each cultivar and then pick those with high values. But, because there are large interaction effects between cultivar and environment (genotype-by-environment effect or G$\times$E)
